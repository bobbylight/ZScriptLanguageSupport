--- Global Functions ---

int Rand(int maxvalue)
 * Computes and returns a random integer i such that 0 <= i < maxvalue.
 * The return value is undefined if maxvalue is 0 or negative.

void Quit()
 * Terminates execution of the current script. Does not return.

void Waitframe()
 * Temporarily halts execution of the current script. This function returns at the beginning of the next frame of gameplay.
 * Slots 1, 3 and 4 Global scripts and item scripts only execute for one frame, so in those scripts Waitframe() is essentially Quit().
 * It is safe to call Waitframe in the active global script.

void Waitdraw()
 * Halts execution of the script until ZC's internal code has been run (movement, collision detection, etc.),
 * but before the screen is drawn.  This can only be used in the active global script.

void Trace(float val)
 * Prints a line containing a string representation of val to allegro.log.
 * Useful for debugging scripts.

void TraceB(bool state)
 * Prints a boolean state to allegro.log

void TraceS(int[] s)
 * Takes the array pointer as its argument, and prints it as a string to allegro.log
 * Maximum 512 characters. Functions from string.zh can be used to split larger strings.

void TraceToBase(int val, int base, int mindigits)
 * Prints a line in allegro.log representing 'val' in numerical base 'base',
 * where 2 <= base <= 36, with minimum digits 'mindigits'.
 * Can be useful for checking hex values or flags ORed together, or just to trace
 * an integer value, as Trace() always traces to four decimal places.

void TraceNL()
 * Traces a newline to allegro.log

void ClearTrace()
 * Clears allegro.log of all current traces and messages from Zelda Classic/ZQuest.

float Sin(float deg)

 * also negative values of exp may not be useful, as the return value is
 * truncated to the nearest integer.

int InvPow(int base, int exp)
 * Returns base^(1/exp). The return value is undefined for exp=0, or
 * if exp is even and base is negative. Note also that negative values
 * of exp may not be useful, as the return value is truncated to the
 * nearest integer.

float Log10(float val)
 * Returns the log of val to the base 10. Any value &lt;= 0 will return 0.

float Ln(float val)
 * Returns the natural logarithm of val (to the base e). Any value &lt;= 0 will return 0.

int Factorial(int val)
 * Returns val!. val &lt; 0 returns 0.

float Abs(float val)
 * Return the absolute value of the parameter, if possible. If the
 * absolute value would overflow the parameter, the return value is
 * undefined.

int Dir

 * handle movement and collision. Use any value below -1 if you want a
 * dummy weapon that you can control on your own.
 * Given a deadstate value of -10, a weapon will turn of its collision
 * detection and movement. If it has a positive value, it will

int Family
 * The kind of item to which this class belongs (swords, boomerangs,

int Amount
 * Corresponds to the "Increase Amount" entry in the Item Editor.

 * If Amount & 0x8000 is 1, the drain counter for this item is set
 * to Amount & 0x3FFF. The game then slowly fills the counter of this item

 * If Max is less than the current maximum of the counter, Max is ignored
 * and that maximum is used instead.
 * Notice that as a special case, if Max = MaxIncrement, the counter's

 * In conjunction with Max (see above) this value controls how the
 * maximum value of the counter of this item (see Counter below) is
 * modified when the item is picked up. If MaxIncrement is nonzero at that
 * time, the counter's new maximum value is at that time set to the
 * minimum of its current value plus MaxIncrement, and Max.
